## Contributing

I'd love to see your contributions to this project. Feel free to fork it and submit a pull request.

Here are some ideas for contributions:

- fix: we should be able to run `zeus preview` but it fails with error "Please set at least one package"
- feat: add a script to automate the generation of a QR code for the watchface
- chore: improve the readme to explain how to live preview the watchface
- chore: rename images to more meaningful names, instead of just numbers
- feat: `npm run zip` should create a new versioned zip file and delete previous ones
